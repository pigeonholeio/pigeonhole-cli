	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// deleteCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	SecretsDeleteCmd.Flags().BoolP("all", "a", false, "Delete all secrets that you have sent/received")
